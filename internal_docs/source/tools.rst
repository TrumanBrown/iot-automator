Tools
=========================

All developers are welcome to use whatever tools that they would like, but they are encouraged 
to use some of the tools below. 

------------------

Python
--------

We are currently working off of Python **3.7.6**, but plan to support more versions in the future. We likely will 
not be supporting any Python 2 versions.

IDE
----

.. note::
	We understand that IDE's are very near and dear to developers hearts, this is just a suggestion and what we are using.


We are using **Visual Studio 2022 - Community** for development. Below are some add-ons and configuration details that make 
development easier.

.. dropdown:: Installing & Configuring VS 2022
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    By following the above link you can download Visual Studio 2022. We use community edition such that we do not have 
    to pay extra, but professional and enterprise will work as well.

    When choosing a configuration, we suggest using the attached configuration file for importing settings.
